      description: 'All Tyent Water Ionizers come with standard medical-grade Solid Hybrid Mesh Plate technology. Solid Hybrid Mesh Plate plates offer more strength, durability & more surface area because of Solid Hybrid Mesh Plate design. Our engineers begin the Tyent plate-making process with the thickest and longest plates in the industry, and then they incorporate cutting-edge electrolysis distribution methods for maximum electrical conductivity. Most ionizers have plates that are either solid or mesh. Tyent engineers were not satisfied with either design. Here’s why: Solid plates offer strength but lack premium electrical distribution. Since electricity is drawn to edges (which is why a lightning rod has a pointed edge) a solid plate’s electrical current will only be transmitted around the outer edge of the plate. The edges are key, which is why mesh plates seem ideal; but since they lack durability, they do not meet Tyent’s high standards. Since neither of the available plate styles was sufficient, our Tyent engineers developed the cutting-edge Tyent Solid Hybrid Mesh Plates. The Tyent Solid Hybrid Mesh Plate was engineered according to Faraday’s electrolysis distribution methods.',

Super Water means that Tyent ionizer\'s have a range of 2.5 to 11.5* on the pH scale, while our water ionizers have a range of 10.0 to 4.0* on the pH scale. On the low end of this scale, water with a pH of 2.5 - 3.5 works as an antiseptic and can be used as an all-natural sanitizer on surfaces. On the high end of this scale, water with a pH of 11 and higher is great to use for removing oil-based herbicides, pesticides & wax content from fruits and vegetables.
